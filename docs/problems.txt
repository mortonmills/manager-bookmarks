PROBLEM
After opening up the input file, I saw that I was only able to select one file at a time.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file#multiple
SOLUTION
By default it is single, so I needed to add the multiple file attribute.


PROBLEM
Upon testing my code, there was no content registering on the console.
SOLUTION
I had forgotten to add file tags to the script src. 
That one slipped by me for awhile. 
I then turned off Selected Context Only in the console.

<script src="scripts/bbm-merger"></script> //ERROR
<script src="scripts/bbm-merger.js"></script> //RIGHT


PROBLEM
When appending string at array, the merged button must be pushed twice.
SOLUTION
Since the FileReader is async, the script finished before the filereader was finished loading.
The file read must synced, so use Promises with the async/await syntax.


PROBLEM
I was getting the same file when working with devtools workspaces and the file would not update.
I thought it was either a caching problem with devtools or the python simple server.
SOLUTION
In the devtools preferences I disabled Preferences > Network > disable caching (while devtools is open)
If you don't want disable caching, another fix might be to use incognito mode.


PROBLEM
Could not call function within event listener.
SOLUTION
Eventlisteners only allow callbacks. 
Must use an anoymous function to call with parameters, ()=>handleFiles(fileInput)



PROBLEM
bookmarks file isn't showing all files, only 2
SOLUTION
Each file group folder needed to have a header before it
Before
<DL><p>
</DL></p>
After
<DT><H3></H3>
<DL><p>
</DL></p>
